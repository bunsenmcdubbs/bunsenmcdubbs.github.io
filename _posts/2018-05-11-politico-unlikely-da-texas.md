This was a feel-good inspiring profile on a lower-profile (to me at least) member
of the reform movement that is happening in America and also an early part
(elected in 2016) of the proported "blue-wave" that is happening in response to the
2016 election. I am very interested to see how Gonzalez's career continues and how
he makes an impact in his community.

> Gonzalez, a 38-year-old Democrat and self-described “Mexican biker lawyer covered in tattoos.” &hellip; [he] specialized in getting accused criminals off the hook—working most closely with low-income, mostly minority offenders, fighting low-level charges for marijuana and other substances. His pride in his work is expressed in a spectacular tattoo that he had inked across his chest a few years ago, reading, in colorful gothic type, “Not Guilty.”
