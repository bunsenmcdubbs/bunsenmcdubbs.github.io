<h1>Andrew Dai is a 🧙 senior 💪 software engineer 🧑‍💻 with a great personality.</h1>
<section>
    <p>I've worked as a software engineer in a variety of environments in the Silicon Valley tech industry from small
        and medium startups to large, mature tech companies. I am most experienced with backend, infrastructure, and platform
        domains with expertise in Kubernetes, both GCP and AWS, Postgres, various CI/CD systems and SDLC practices,
        and performance optimization.
        In my experience, meaningful challenges are both technical and social in nature. Software architecture and
        better processes are two sides of the same coin and a highly collaborative team is worth its weight in gold.
    </p>
    <p>I am not currently looking for a new job, but you can reach out and offer me a sick job anyway. See some of my
        open source contributions on <a href="https://github.com/bunsenmcdubbs/">github</a>.</p>
